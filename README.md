<em>Completed August 9, 2017</em>

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game I created while going through the advanced front end development projects on freeCodeCamp. I was tasked with creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user can play a game against an AI apponent, be able to play again as soon as a game is over, and be able to choose whether they are playing as 'X' or 'O'.

I was slightly surprised how quickly I was able to throw this project together. After messing with JavaScript classes for the past few projects, I feel a lot more comfortable working with them now. From the start of this project I knew exactly how I wanted things to be laid out and how I was going to go about doingthem. I decided to mess around with including a option type menu that would hide once the start game button was pressed; then the game board would appear.

If I were to improve something further in this project it would be to refactor the code I have written to condense it, and make it cleaner. While I completed this project quickly I let feel as though I could have made everything a lot cleaner.
